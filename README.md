# WSI-GTFE



Code is undergoing refactoring from our original command line interface. We will update our code base with a fully functioning CLI. For now, we have included some example notebooks for getting started on your own datasets in the notebooks section.    

Feel free to check out our article, here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.231639v1
